open two terminal windows in linux

in the first one - run ./_create.sh;
   this will create and run the docker-container with postgresql and all *.sql files from the folder

in the second one run ./_psql.sh
   this will open the container's psql shell

and now you can execute any sql statements or metacommands
or execute .sql files; to execute .sql file use the following command:
   \i /repo/some_file_name.sql
