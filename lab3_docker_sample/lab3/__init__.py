# The file "init.py" is a special file in Python that is used to mark a directory as a Python package.
# When the Python interpreter encounters a directory containing an init.py file, it recognizes the
# directory as a package and allows you to import modules from the package.

# The init.py file can be empty, or it can contain Python code that initializes the package.
# This code might include importing modules, defining functions or classes, or setting up
# package-level configuration.

# In addition to marking a directory as a package, the init.py file also controls the behavior
# of the package when it is imported. For example, you can use the all variable in the init.py
# file to specify which modules should be imported when the package is imported using the * syntax.

# Overall, the init.py file is an important part of creating a well-structured Python package
# and provides a way to organize and control the behavior of the package.
